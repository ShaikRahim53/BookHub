# BookHub
BookHub is an app where it can have list of books. You mark them as favourites and sort them in the dashboard. This app has total four main fragments. The dashboard, Favourites, Profile and About. I have wirtten code only for dashboard and favourites. And it works only if there is internet connection. It works in portrait and non-split mode.
